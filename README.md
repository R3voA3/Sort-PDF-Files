Sorts all PDF files in the selected folder by their sheet size (A0, A1, A2, A3, A4). 

Files that have pages with different sheet sizes or where sheet sizes varies are sorted into a folder called "unknown_size".

PDF files that contain ".bom" or ".bomall" in their name are copied into the "BOMs" folder.

This tool is meant to be used when many PDF files need to be sorted before getting printed. Useful for printing technical drawings.
